# Artificial Fever
This is the (public and out of date) repo for artificial fever, a webstore that one of my clients requested I rebuild with modern technologies. It's based on the Fluid hydrogen starter from sanity.io and uses their cms for all of the content not directly pulled from Shopify. Look around if you want proof I know how to write GraphQL queries.
